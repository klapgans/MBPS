import numpy as np

def fcn_euler_forward(diff, t_span, y0, h=1.0):
    """ Function for Euler Forward numerical integration.
    Based on the syntax of scipy.integrate.solve_ivp
    
    This function numerically integrates a system of ordinary differential
    equations, given an initial value::

        dy/dt = f(t, y)
        y(t0) = y0

    Here, t is a one-dimensional independent variable (time), y(t) is an
    n-dimensional vector-valued function (state), and an n-dimensional
    vector-valued function f(t, y) determines the differential equations.
    The goal is to find y(t) approximately satisfying the differential
    equations, given an initial value y(t0)=y0.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    diff : callable
        Function to calculate the value of d_dt
        (the right-hand side of the system).
    t_span : 2-tuple of floats
        Interval of integration (t0, tf). The solver starts with t=t0 and
        integrates until it reaches t=tf.
    h : float
        Step size for the integration.
    
    Returns
    -------
    Dictionary with the following:\n
    t : ndarray, shape (n_points,)
        Time vector for desired evaluation (based on `t_span` and `h`).
    y : ndarray, shape (n_outputs, n_points)
        Values of the solution at `t`.
